#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### like chat gpt that can help students in everything that concerns un studies  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values to reflect the new app concept (“Chat‑GPT for university studies”).  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to generate the app logo image.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized symbol of a graduation cap combined with a chat bubble, set against a blue and green gradient background, representing an AI assistant for university studies. The design is simple, modern, and includes the app name “ChatGPT for University Studies” in a clean sans-serif font below the symbol.
